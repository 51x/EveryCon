Description
=======
It is possible to visually connect anything to anything or anyone to anyone. This project is intended to create a simple interface for that.

The connection core could be a simple point, continuing with two, three..etc. With four there is possibility for 3D already.

Pre-Alpha version, 0.31


Specs v0.31

Target specifications for beta server side code
  - folder structure as db with specific files
  - flask for logic/web/upload/etc.
  - nginx for static content
  - nodejs for websockets

Interfaces
  - HTTP(S) / HTML5+CSS+JS+websocket
  - zsh

Target specifications for client side web code

Notes, ideas and to do
=======

- Web3 / New HTML ideas
- Interesting integration would be ZeroBin and EtherPad-Lite
- Linked: How Everything is Connected to Everything Else and What....
- "Semantic web technology" - Connecting different things, descriptions from it
- Semantic web, RDF model
- OWL programming
- barabasi.com resources / free publications, downloads, etc
- The project could be placed on a "usb computer", auto-start, limiting requests (could protect info stealing). Etc.


Ideas for use
=======
  - How to live well?
  - I want to store everything.
  - Life organizing generally, including anything like private/work/public
  - Secure/encrypted separation for all apects of life/media contents/etc
  - Could work with Augmenter Reality (AR), on a similar ways as browsers
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Intelligence software, running on it's own / set question, go on enumeration, always show current status, no final answer
  - Anything.
  - Got other name ideas too: treex, vLife, v3das
